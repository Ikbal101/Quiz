        <h4>1.What is the difference between map,filter,forEach an find?</h4>
        <p class="fs-5"><span>Ans:</span> map is used to transform an array without changing the old one, 
            filter is used to select a subset of an array based on a condition,
             forEach is used to perform an action for each element of an array and it's doesn't return anything,
             and find is used to get the first element that matches a condition. <br>
            And this is the difference between all of them.

            <h4>2.what is the difference between localStorage,sectionStorage and cookies??</h4>
            <p class="fs-5"><span>Ans:</span> localStorage stores data permanently in the browser until explicitly cleared by the user or the application.If user refresh or reopen the browser 
                data will be there as it was before. Users also can use and show data from the local storage to their 
                html page. <br>
                sectionStorage doesn't store data for life time..It is only for the session.If user refresh the web page or reopen the page 
                data will be deleted. <br>
                Cookies, on the other hand, are a traditional mechanism for storing data in the browser. 
                It can  storing small pieces of data that need to be sent to the server with each request.

            <h4>3.What is event loop and how does it work?</h4>
            <p class="fs-5"><span>Ans:</span>
                An event loop is a programming construct that handles events and callbacks in an asynchronous environment. It constantly checks for pending events and executes any corresponding callbacks. This allows for efficient use of resources and enables non-blocking I/O operations. The loop keeps running until there are no more pending events to process, at which point it may exit or wait for new events.

            <h4>4.Describing quizTimer():</h4>
            <p class="fs-5"><span>Ans:</span> This is a function which is used to show time top of the right head of the page.
               First quizTimer that takes a single parameter dismiss.
                Inside the function, there is an if statement that checks whether the dismiss parameter is truthy. If it is, the function clears the interval timer (which will stop the timer from running) and returns. <br>
                If the dismiss parameter is falsy, the function creates an interval timer using the setInterval() method. This interval timer calls an anonymous arrow function every 1000 ms..
            </p>

            <h4>5.Describing chooseQuiz(): </h4>
            <p class="fs-5"><span>Ans:</span> It is Used to choose ans from questions and after submitted it shows correct ans too.
                chooseQuiz function  takes two parameters: index and givenAns. The code first checks if an object with a matching id property exists in the answers array using the find() method. If a match is found, the code updates the givenAns property of the matching object with the new givenAns value.

                If no matching object is found, the code creates a new object by spreading the quizData[index] object and adding the givenAns property to it. The new object is then pushed into the answers array.
                
                Finally, the displayAnswers() function is called with the updated answers array as its argument.
